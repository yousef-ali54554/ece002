		<h2>What Is The Importance Of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
		<p>It might be easier to state what part of our modern society artificial intelligence (AI) hasnâ€™t touched to show how important it is to our daily lives, business operations and society. Intelligence machines are influencing nearly every facet of our lives to help improve efficiencies and augment our human capabilities. AI is so intertwined in all that we do; it's hard to imagine living life without it.</p>
		<h3>While there are many reasons to prioritize learning about AI, here are a few that I believe are most important:</h3>
		<h4>The speed of AI Implementation: </h4>
		<p>New AI technologies are being introduced at an incredibly fast pace, and it can be challenging to keep up. At this point, only a handful of people truly understand all of the implications these quickly evolving technologies will have for our world. Naturally, these rapid changes will generate some challenges.</p>
		<h4>Large tech companies giving priority to AI:</h4>
		<p>Even Google, a company that used to say that mobile was its priority, has shifted its focus toward AI. Nearly every tech company is heavily investing in AI research and development, which demonstrates the importance that AI, holds for businesses in general.</p>
		<h4>Lack of Knowledgeable Workers:</h4>
		<p>Because AI is overgrowing, there is a great need for more data scientists, machine learning experts, and other technical professionals who can build out AI solutions and services. There is also a shortage of other professionals, such as teachers and consultants, to help to explain the implications of the growth of AI, which will, in turn, help businesses and individuals adapt to the new realities.</p>
		<h4>Legal Implications Worldwide:</h4>
		<p>In almost every country, laws and regulations will need to be reviewed and updated to incorporate the new trends of the AI era. There is also a demand for information on the ways that societies can benefit by applying AI to various fields like healthcare and transportation.</p>
		<h4>Collaboration between Private and Public Sectors:</h4>
		<p>Research and development of AI should not only be taking place in large tech companies. Instead, there needs to be open and robust collaboration internationally, as well as between companies of all sizes, and between the public and private sectors.</p>
