		<h3>Now let's talk about the advantages and disadvantages AI</h3>
		<h2>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>Error Reduction:</h4>
				<p>Artificial intelligence helps us in reducing the error and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision. It is applied in various studies such as exploration of space.</p>
				<p>Intelligent robots are fed with information and are sent to explore space. Since they are machines with metal bodies, they are more resistant and have a greater ability to endure the space and hostile atmosphere.</p>
				<p>They are created and acclimatized in such a way that they cannot be modified or get disfigured or breakdown in a hostile environment.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4> Difficult Exploration:</h4>
				<p>Artificial intelligence and the science of robotics can be put to use in mining and other fuel exploration processes. Not only that, these complex machines can be used for exploring the ocean floor and hence overcome the human limitations.</p>
				<p>Due to the programming of the robots, they can perform more laborious and hard work with greater responsibility. Moreover, they do not wear out easily.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Daily Application:</h4>
				<p>Computed methods for automated reasoning, learning and perception have become a common phenomenon in our everyday lives. We have our lady Siri or Cortana to help us out.</p>
				<p>We are also hitting the road for long drives and trips with the help of GPS. The smartphone is an apt and everyday example of how we use artificial intelligence. In utilities, we find that they can predict what we are going to type and correct the human errors in spelling. That is machine intelligence at work.</p>
				<p>When we take a picture, the artificial intelligence algorithm identifies and detects the person’s face and tags the individuals when we are posting our photographs on social media sites.</p>
				<p>Artificial Intelligence is widely employed by financial institutions and banking institutions to organize and manage data. Detection of fraud uses artificial intelligence in a smart card based system.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Digital Assistants:</h4>
				<p>Highly advanced organizations use ‘avatars’ which are replicas or digital assistants who can actually interact with the users, thus saving the need for human resources.</p>
				<p>For artificial thinkers, emotions come in the way of rational thinking and are not a distraction at all. The complete absence of the emotional side, makes the robots think logically and take the right program decisions.</p>
				<p>Emotions are associated with moods that can cloud judgment and affect human efficiency. This is completely ruled out for machine intelligence.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>High Cost:</h4>
				<p>Creation of artificial intelligence requires huge costs as they are very complex machines. Their repair and maintenance require huge costs.</p>
				<p>They have software programs which need frequent up gradation to cater to the needs of the changing environment and the need for the machines to be smarter by the day.</p>
				<p>In the case of severe breakdowns, the procedure to recover lost codes and reinstating the system might require huge time and cost.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>No Replicating Humans:</h4>
				<p>Intelligence is believed to be a gift of nature. An ethical argument continues, whether human intelligence is to be replicated or not.</p>
				<p>Machines do not have any emotions and moral values. They perform what is programmed and cannot make the judgment of right or wrong. Even cannot take decisions if they encounter a situation unfamiliar to them. They either perform incorrectly or breakdown in such situations.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>No Improvement with Experience:</h4>
				<p>Unlike humans, artificial intelligence cannot be improved with experience. With time, it can lead to wear and tear. It stores a lot of data but the way it can be accessed and used is very different from human intelligence.</p>
				<p>Machines are unable to alter their responses to changing environments. We are constantly bombarded by the question of whether it is really exciting to replace humans with machines.</p>
				<p>In the world of artificial intelligence, there is nothing like working with a whole heart or passionately. Care or concerns are not present in the machine intelligence dictionary. There is no sense of belonging or togetherness or a human touch. They fail to distinguish between a hardworking individual and an inefficient individual.</p>
