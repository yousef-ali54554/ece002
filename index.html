		<h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
		<p>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>
		<p>As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations[9].</p>
		<p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other.These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences. Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).</p>
		<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.</p>
		<h2>HOW DOES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORK?</h2>
		<p>Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?"</p>
		<p>Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.</p>
		<p>At it's core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.</p>
		<p>The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.</p>

		<p>Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI:</p>

			<li><strong>Thinking humanly</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Thinking rationally</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Acting humanly</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Acting rationally</strong></li>
