		<h2>History of artificial intelligence</h2>
		<p>The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.</p>
		<p>The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956.Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.</p>
		<p>Eventually, it became obvious that they had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. In 1973, in response to the criticism from James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from congress, the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence, and the difficult years that followed would later be known as an "AI winter". Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government inspired governments and industry to provide AI with billions of dollars, but by the late 80s the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again.</p>
		<h3>1940-1960: Birth of AI in the wake of cybernetics</h3>
		<p>The period between 1940 and 1960 was strongly marked by the conjunction of technological developments (of which the Second World War was an accelerator) and the desire to understand how to bring together the functioning of machines and organic beings. For Norbert Wiener, a pioneer in cybernetics, the aim was to unify mathematical theory, electronics and automation as "a whole theory of control and communication, both in animals and machines". Just before, a first mathematical and computer model of the biological neuron (formal neuron) had been developed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts as early as 1943.</p>
		<p>At the beginning of 1950, John Von Neumann and Alan Turing did not create the term AI but were the founding fathers of the technology behind it: they made the transition from computers to 19th century decimal logic (which thus dealt with values from 0 to 9) and machines to binary logic (which rely on Boolean algebra, dealing with more or less important chains of 0 or 1). The two researchers thus formalized the architecture of our contemporary computers and demonstrated that it was a universal machine, capable of executing what is programmed. Turing, on the other hand, raised the question of the possible intelligence of a machine for the first time in his famous 1950 article "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" and described a "game of imitation", where a human should be able to distinguish in a teletype dialogue whether he is talking to a man or a machine. However controversial this article may be (this "Turing test" does not appear to qualify for many experts), it will often be cited as being at the source of the questioning of the boundary between the human and the machine.</p>
		<p>The term "AI" could be attributed to John McCarthy of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), which Marvin Minsky (Carnegie-Mellon University) defines as "the construction of computer programs that engage in tasks that are currently more satisfactorily performed by human beings because they require high-level mental processes such as: perceptual learning, memory organization and critical reasoning. The summer 1956 conference at Dartmouth College (funded by the Rockefeller Institute) is considered the founder of the discipline. Anecdotally, it is worth noting the great success of what was not a conference but rather a workshop. Only six people, including McCarthy and Minsky, had remained consistently present throughout this work (which relied essentially on developments based on formal logic).</p>
		<h2>1980-1990: Expert systems</h2>
		<p>In 1968 Stanley Kubrick directed the film "2001 Space Odyssey" where a computer - HAL 9000 (only one letter away from those of IBM) summarizes in itself the whole sum of ethical questions posed by AI: will it represent a high level of sophistication, a good for humanity or a danger? The impact of the film will naturally not be scientific but it will contribute to popularize the theme, just as the science fiction author Philip K. Dick, who will never cease to wonder if, one day, the machines will experience emotions.</p>
		<p>It was with the advent of the first microprocessors at the end of 1970 that AI took off again and entered the golden age of expert systems.</p>
		<p>The path was actually opened at MIT in 1965 with DENDRAL (expert system specialized in molecular chemistry) and at Stanford University in 1972 with MYCIN (system specialized in the diagnosis of blood diseases and prescription drugs). These systems were based on an "inference engine," which was programmed to be a logical mirror of human reasoning. By entering data, the engine provided answers of a high level of expertise.</p>
		<p>The promises foresaw a massive development but the craze will fall again at the end of 1980, early 1990. The programming of such knowledge actually required a lot of effort and from 200 to 300 rules, there was a "black box" effect where it was not clear how the machine reasoned. Development and maintenance thus became extremely problematic and - above all - faster and in many other less complex and less expensive ways were possible. It should be recalled that in the 1990s, the term artificial intelligence had almost become taboo and more modest variations had even entered university language, such as "advanced computing".</p>
		<p>The success in May 1997 of Deep Blue (IBM's expert system) at the chess game against Garry Kasparov fulfilled Herbert Simon's 1957 prophecy 30 years later but did not support the financing and development of this form of AI. The operation of Deep Blue was based on a systematic brute force algorithm, where all possible moves were evaluated and weighted. The defeat of the human remained very symbolic in the history but Deep Blue had in reality only managed to treat a very limited perimeter (that of the rules of the chess game), very far from the capacity to model the complexity of the world.</p>
